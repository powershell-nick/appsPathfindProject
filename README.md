# UTSA Pathfinder
Apps Fall 2019 Project CS3443

The general purpose of this application is to calculate a visual pathway from one building to a specified destination building in UTSA.

How to use:
  - Upon initialization, you will be brought to a screen of the map of the campus as well as a list of buildings to the left. You may also click and drag the map to move it around. There are also buttons to zoom in/out, and to toggle the screen layout.
  - Click on a building name and click "Search Map" to find that building.
  - Next, if you want to set that building as your starting location, you may do so.
  - Repeat the previous two steps to set an end destination.
  - That's it! You now have a visual idea on where to go. Afterwards, you may click "Clear Search" and search again.
  
Note: If the map does not appear on the screen upon initialization, load the project's FXML file to Scene Builder. Then, open the project's folder, find the mappic image, and click and drag that on to the map pane in SceneBuilder.
